# TTRPG Cards

An attempt to make a system for creating printable TTRPG cards.

## Development

The project currently has no runtime dependencies, but it does have several development dependencies, which can be installed with `npm install`.

- `npm start` will run a development server.
  - You may need to either disable caching or hard-reload to have the browser update the static files.
- `npm run lint` will lint the codebase.
- `npm run types` will run TypeScript type-checking against the (plain JavaScript) code.
