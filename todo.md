# To Do

- Render the sections from code as well.
- Setup input fields to modify the sections.
- The controls shouldn't scroll with the page.
- Handle adding new cards
- Handle selecting which card you want to edit
- Handle deleting cards, including removing listeners

- Come up with a name for the project. The card-view component should be project-card, where project is replaced with the project name (and other component names should be changed accordingly.)
