# To Do

- Handle deleting cards, including removing listeners.
- Add serialisation.
- Save to local storage on any change.
- Load from local storage on initialisation.
- Support export and import to/from a file.
- Have a button to trigger the print dialogue.
- Support the option to show only the front-of-card pages, only the back-of-card pages, or both, interspersed, for double sided printing.
- Drag and drop to re-order tags and details.
- Come up with a name for the project. The card-view component should be project-card, where project is replaced with the project name (and other component names should be changed accordingly.)\
  - Cardio?

- Support "undo".
